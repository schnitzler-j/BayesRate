# BayesRate
BayesRate is a program to estimate speciation and extinction rates from dated phylogenies in a Bayesian framework.

The methods are described in:

Silvestro, D., Schnitzler, J. and Zizka, G. (2011) A Bayesian framework to estimate diversification rates and their variation through time and space. BMC Evolutionary Biology, 11, 311

Silvestro D., Zizka G. & Schulte K. (2014) Disentangling the effects of key innovations on the diversification of Bromelioideae (Bromeliaceae). Evolution, 68, 163-175.


BayesRate currently runs under Mac OS X and Windows. Please note that under Windows some functions have restricted options, but this does not affect the overall capabilities of the program. BayesRate was successfully tested using R versions 2.13 - 3.3, and Python versions 2.6.4 and 2.7 (but currently does not support Python 3).
